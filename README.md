# D-score

`dscore` is a meta-server tool for the prediction of disordered regions in protein sequences. It works by querying several webservers and gathering the results in an easy-to-use format. All the work is automated using simple web requests where possible, falling back to webscraping with `selenium` for servers without a public API.

# Installation

`dscore` is available on PyPi and easily [installable with `pip`](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-pip-on-ubuntu-18.04/):

```
pip install dscore
```

## Firefox webdriver

To run, `dscore` also requires the `Firefox` webdriver to be installed. Download the latest version of the driver [from the official github release](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/latest): scroll down and choose the appropriate one (for example, the `...linux64.tar.gz` for a 64bit linux installation). Make sure to unzip/untar the driver and make it accessible on the `PATH` enviroment variable. [Here's a detailed guide on how to do this](https://dev.to/eugenedorfling/installing-the-firefox-web-driver-on-linux-for-selenium-d45).

# Usage

*Note that this program works by opening a ton of firefox windows and issuing automated commands. Let it do its thing and don't get scared! :)*

**DISCLAIMER**: `dscore` relies on other webservers for its results. Some of these servers have limitations on the amount of requests per user, so you may get temporarily blocked if you submit too many sequences. Spread them out!

`dscore` can be used either as a python library or from the command line. The latter has a simple interface:

```
dscore --help
```

For example, this command will run the `fast` subset of servers (about 30 seconds to get results):

```
dscore my_proteins.fasta -o output_dir -s fast
```

You will find the output files inside `output_dir`, including raw data in dscore format and several useful plots.
